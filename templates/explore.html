          <p>The dominant food crop of Bangladesh is rice, accounting for about 75 percent of agricultural land use (and 28 percent of GDP). The cultivation of rice in Bangladesh varies according to seasonal changes in the water supply. The largest harvest is aman, occurring in November and December and accounting for more than half of annual production. Some rice for the aman harvest is sown in the spring through the broadcast method, matures during the summer rains, and is harvested in the fall. The higher yielding method involves starting the seeds in special beds and transplanting during the summer monsoon. The second harvest is aus, involving traditional strains but more often including high-yielding, dwarf varieties. Rice for the aus harvest is sown in March or April, benefits from April and May rains, matures during the summer rain, and is harvested during the summer. With the increasing use of irrigation, there has been a growing focus on another rice-growing season extending during the dry season from October to March. The production of this boro rice, including high-yield varieties, expanded rapidly until the mid-1980s, when production leveled off at just below 4 million tons. Where irrigation is feasible, it is normal for fields throughout Bangladesh to produce rice for two harvests annually.  
          <br>Now we will know about some rice diseases.

                <p>The fungus attacks the crop at all stages of crop growth. Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, rachis and glumes. On the leaves, the lesions appear as small bluish green flecks, which enlarge under moist weather to form the characteristic spindle shaped spots with grey center and dark brown margin (leaf blast).The spots coalesce as the disease progress and large areas of the leaves dry up and wither. Spots also appear on sheath. Severely infected nursery and field appear as burnt. The affected nodes may break up and all the plants above the infected nodes may die (nodal blast).

                <br>Rice is the staple food crop for a large part of the human population in the world today. Rice
                Blast is by far the most important disease of the many diseases that attack rice. It is found wherever rice is grown, it is always important, and it is always a threat. Failures of entire
                rice crops have resulted directly from rice blast epidemics. The challenge for research continues to be to produce high quality food, in ever-increasing amounts at a lower costs, all while in the presence of an unforgiving and unrelenting pathogen. All of the plant disease management strategies and techniques that have been generated through research have been brought to bear against rice blast, but often with limited success. Rice blast has never been eliminated from a region in which rice is grown, and a single change in the way in
                which rice is grown or in the way resistance genes are deployed can result in significant disease losses even after years of successful management. This disease is a model that
                demonstrate the seriousness, elusiveness, and longevity of some plant diseases. Rice blast has been widely studied throughout the world. Many investigators have considered it to be a model disease for the study of genetics, epidemiology, molecular pathology of host
                parasite interactions and biology. Recent advances in understanding the genes that gover the avirulence (resistance) and virulence (susceptibility) interactions have been made with rice blast, and each advance has helped us to understand how other plant diseases work. It is also important to note that the entire genomes of the rice blast fungus and rice have been sequenced and that M. oryzae is the first plant pathogenic fungus to have its genome
                sequenced and released to the public.

                    The symptoms of stripe rust are the same on wheat and barley. Yellow pustules of stripe rust can occur on all aerial parts of Leaf the plant, but are most frequently seen on the leaves. Individual pustules (uredia) are roughly circular and about 0.5-1 mm in diameter. The pustules are often arranged into conspicuous stripes and their linear orientation between vascular bundles can progress the length of the leaf blade. On seedlings, pustules appear individually rather than in lines. During the summer, stripe rust infection of wheat spikes may occur, resulting in the formation of masses of spores between the glume and the lemma. At the end of the season, black telia may form in patches of tissue that have been killed by stripe rust uredia.
                    <br>Stripe rust of wheat is caused by the basidiomycete fungus.
                    <br>The most effective, economic and practical means of control of stripe rust on wheat or barley I through the use of varieties that are resistant to P. striiformis. The frequency of severe epidemics of wheat stripe rust has been obviously reduced in West European countries, North America, China and India since the introduction of resistant wheat varieties in the early 1970s. Work on the development of resistant wheat varieties continues throughout the world. To stabilize the pathogen population and decrease epidemic frequency, it is important to use different sources of variety resistance, including major-gene resistance, polygenic resistance, high-temperature resistance, and adult-plant resistance (Mundt and Browning, 1985).

                    On individual leaves, the symptoms of wheat streak mosaic start as small chlorotic lines. As the symptom development progresses, chlorotic lines elongate to form discontinuous yellow to pale green streaks, forming a mosaic pattern in the leaves. In severe cases, the stripes may coalesce, forming large chlorotic areas, and commonly result in the symptoms progressing into leaf tissue necrosis and plant death. Stunting is another prominent symptom of infected plants.

            Maize is the third most important cereal crop in Bangladesh. As maize has a high adaptability to the country's climate and soil conditions, it is a perfect match for fallow lands, river islands (chars), the Chittagong Hill tracks and the disaster prone coastal areas. The growing demand of maize for feed market adds to its profitability as a crop. Yet, the 570,000 farmers in Bangladesh who grow maize meet only 70% of domestic demand. The low supply of produce is rooted in low quality inputs, limited knowledge, wrong cultivation techniques and post-harvest losses.<br>
            Now we will know about some maize diseases.

                    The fungus can infect many different parts of the host plant, typically the kernels and tassels of Maize, roots, leaves, stalk and husks. The most common area of infection is the stalk. G. raminicola produces three major symptom types: leaf blight, stalk rot and top die-back. The leaf blight is characterized by round yellowing water soaked lesions on the leaves. These lesions usually occur early in the season and are how this pathogen is distinguished from other diseases. Top die-back is the necrosis of the top leaves and stalk of the corn. This occurs around the same time as grain formation. The stalk rot phase becomes prominent during the late reproductive stages of the corn life cycle. It is characterized by blackening of the pith tissue in the stalk and also of the rind, beginning at the nodes closest to the soil. Along with these symptoms, seedling blight and post emergence damping off are also found. 
                    <br>The fungus overwinters as mycelium or sclerotia in corn residue or seed. Spores are spread primarily by splashing water. Disease development is favored by wet weather during early crop growth with moderately warm temperatures. Anthracnose leaf blight is most common where corn follows corn.
                    <br>Since C. graminicola is found to survive on corn residue, specifically on the soil surface; one of the most effective methods of control is a one-year minimum of crop rotation to reduce anthracnose leaf blight. A study in 2009 showed more severe symptoms of leaf blight due to C. graminicola when grown on fields previously used for corn in comparison to fields previously used for soybean. Other management methods include the use of hybrid selections and tillage systems. Keeping in mind, hybrid selection may be resistant to leaf blight but they are not necessary resistant to other fungal diseases such as stalk rot. Tillage systems that are able to fully bury corn residue deep underground along with one year crop rotation will reduce the source of inoculum greatly. More work is still needed in order to determine the influence of buried and surface corn residues as a source of inoculum for corn anthracnose.

                  Reddish brown ova I spots appear on young seedlings with blight yellow, margin. In severe case, several spots coalesce to cause drying of leaves. It is a complex disease, having association of A. triticina, B. sorokiniana and A. alternate.
                  <br>Infection pressure is considerably different from year to year. Warm and humid weather in early summer sets favorable conditions for an epidemic.
                  <br>The best practice for management of southern corn leaf blight is breeding for host resistance. Both single gene and polygene resistance sources have been discovered. Normal cytoplasm maize can resist both Race T and Race C, hence the more widespread presence of Race O. In some resistant hybrids flecking may be found, but is only a reaction to resistance and will not cause loss of economic significance. Other methods of control can prevent the spread of all races. For example, it is important to manage crop debris between growing seasons, as B. maydis overwinters in the leaf and sheath debris. Tillage can be used to help encourage breakdown of any remaining debris. It has been observed that burying residues by plowing has reduced the occurrence of SCLB as opposed to minimal tillage, which can leave residue on soil surface. Another form of cultural control used to limit southern corn leaf blight is crop rotation with non-host crops. Additionally, foliar fungicides may be used. Foliar disease control is critical from 14 days before to 21 days after tasseling, this is the most susceptible time for damages from leaf blight to occur. The fungicides should be applied to plants infected by SCLB immediately once lesions become apparent. Depending on the environmental conditions, re-applications may be necessary during the growing season.

                      N. aberrans sensu lato causes root galls mainly along the root axis and at the root tips. The galls are superficially similar to those caused by Meloidogyne spp. However, the galls caused by N. aberrans sensu lato tend to be more discrete and rounded, giving a beaded appearance, while those caused by Meloidogyne often coalesce to form elongated swellings along the root. The root knots are in a bead-like arrangement, hence the name rosary-root nematode. Such root-knots may be confused with those produced by Meloidogyne hapla. Mature galls tend to be flat with a rough corky surface and bear many lateral roots (Clark, 1967; Inserra et al., 1983; Manzanilla-López et al., 2002).In heavily attacked plants, the symptoms above ground include poor growth, stunting and yellowing of leaves. Root swellings occur within 5 days of invasion (Altman and Thomason, 1971). There may not be any symptoms with light infections.

            Recent statistics showed that tomato was grown in 30756 ha of land and the total production was approximately 414 thousand metric tons in 2015. Thus the average yield of tomato in Bangladesh was 5.47 t ha-1 (BBS, 2015), while it was 87.96 t ha-1 in USA, 49.87 t ha-1 in China and 20.12 t ha-1 in India (FAOSTAT, 2012).

                    Symptoms of early blight occur on fruit, stem and foliage of tomatoes and stem, foliage and tubers of potatoes.  Initial symptoms on leaves appear as small 1-2 mm black or brown lesions and under conducive environmental conditions the lesions will enlarge and are often surrounded by a yellow halo . Lesions greater than 10 mm in diameter often
                    have dark pigmented concentric rings.  This so-called “bulls eye” type lesion is highly characteristic of early blight. As lesions expand and new lesions develop entire leaves may turn chlorotic and dehisce, leading to significant defoliation.  Lesions occurring on stems are often sunken and lens-shaped with a light center, and  have the typical concentric rings . On young tomato seedlings lesions may completely girdle the stem, a phase of the disease known as “collar rot,” which may lead to reduced plant vigor or death. Infection of both green and ripe tomato fruit normally occurs through the calyx with lesions sometimes reaching a considerable size . The lesions appear leathery and may have the characteristic concentric rings. Infected fruit will frequently drop prematurely. Symptoms on potato tubers are characterized by sunken, irregular lesions, which are often surrounded by a raised purple border. Beneath the surface of the lesion the tuber tissue is leathery or corky with a brown discoloration.  Early blight lesions on tubers tend to be dry and are less prone to invasion by secondary organisms than lesions of other tuber rots.  After prolonged storage severely diseased tubers may become shriveled.
                    <br>Spread over short distances occurs when spores are moved plant-to-plant in wind, rain and overhead irrigation water. Survival occurs in crop remains, and also on seed. Favorable conditions for the disease are warm, humid weather with heavy dews or rain.
                    <br>Rotate your crops: When you harvest a bumper crop one year, it is so tempting to plant in the same spot the following season. However, if tomatoes are the crop in question, restrain yourself! You increase the chance of developing an early blight infection if you grow tomato plants in the same place in consecutive years. Wait at least two years before planting in the same location again, since the spores can persist in the soil and any partially decomposed plants for a year to follow. This is true even if you didn’t see any symptoms of early blight, since the pathogen can start building up without your knowledge. This applies to any crops in the nightshade family as well, such as eggplant, which can also be infected by the fungus.
                    <br>
                    PURGE NIGHTSHADES AND VOLUNTEER TOMATO PLANTS:
                    Plants in the same family as tomatoes (solanaceous plants, or nightshades), and volunteer tomato plants can also serve as hosts for Alternaria species. These can pass the infection on to your tomato plants. This is true for edible crops such as potatoes, as well as hairy nightshade, black nightshade, and horse nettle, so be vigilant and keep these weeds out of your garden. When you remove the weeds and volunteer plants, make sure you destroy them – do not place on your compost pile.
                    <br>KEEP YOUR PLANTS DRY: 
                    The Alternaria spores require a lot of moisture to germinate. Tomato plants are used to growing in dry climates, so they are unusually sensitive to water on their leaves, which makes them more prone to fungal infections than many other crops. Take every precaution you can to minimize the amount of moisture on your tomato plants. In the presence of spores, this can help to prevent a fungal infection from getting worse. Try to avoid working with or around your plants in wet weather. Using drip irrigation instead of watering from overhead will help to keep your plants dry.
                    <br>STAKE YOUR PLANTS:
                    When your plants are staked, this helps to create better airflow around them, helping them to stay dry. Another benefit is that there will be less contact between the leaves and the soil that could be contaminated with spores. Pruning the suckers at the bottom of the plant will also help. However, don’t wait until your tomatoes are fully grown to stake them. You should put the stakes in at the time of planting. If you stake them later on, you risk damaging the roots. Learn how to use Florida weave to support your tomato plants. 
                    <br>REMOVE INFECTED PLANTS:
                    If you see signs of early blight on one or two of your plants, it’s best to pull them up and destroy the debris immediately. Do not place it on the compost pile. You’ll then need to inspect the rest of your crops to check for symptoms, and treat accordingly, as discussed below.

                    Bacterial spot occurs on peppers and tomatoes. Many of the disease features are similar for both crops. The focus of the information presented here is on pepper. Worldwide, 16.5 million metric tons (36 million tons) of peppers are grown for fresh consumption and for use in condiments. For many people in the U.S., the bell-shaped pepper fruit is the most familiar however; non-bell-type peppers are more widely grown. Bacteria attack the foliage, stems, and fruit of peppers and tomatoes. On peppers, lesions may form on fruit, including the peduncle, but the major crop loss. Results from shedding of blossoms and young, developing fruit. Fruit that remain are usually non-marketable because of poor quality. They may have lesions and are often misshapen and damaged from excessive exposure to the sun as a result of defoliation. This can result in sunscald on the fruit . Diseased leaves drop prematurely resulting in extensive defoliation. As newly emerging leaves become infected and defoliation of older, diseased leaves continues, plants possess leaves mostly on their upper stems. Generally, defoliation is more common for peppers than for tomatoes. Because the diseased foliage often remains on tomato plants, affected plants may have a scorched appearance.
                    <br>Optimal conditions for bacterial leaf spot are high moisture, high relative humidity (≥ 80%) and warm temperatures (75-90 °F).
                    <br>The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified,
                    seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas. Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants- including your own! In the greenhouse, discard trays adjacent to outbreak location to minimize disease spread.
                    Treat seeds with dilute bleach, hydrochloric acid, or hot water to reduce the potential for seedling infection. However, this seed treatment is not recommended for producers that use pelleted seeds as it will remove the pelleted coating from seeds. These treatments may also reduce seed germination. Perform a test treatment on
                    approximately 50 to 100 seeds and check for the effect on germination before treating
                    an entire seed lot. For specific instructions and recommendations please consult
                    The Southeastern US Vegetable Crop Handbook.
                     In transplant production greenhouses, minimize overwatering and handling of
                    seedlings when they are wet.
                     Trays, benches, tools, and greenhouse structures should be washed and
                    Sanitized between seedlings crops. Crop rotation should be used to avoid pathogen carryover on volunteers and crop
                    residue. Avoid fields that have been planted with peppers or tomatoes within one year,
                    Especially if they had bacterial spot previously.
                    Eliminate solanaceous weeds in and around tomato and pepper production areas.
                    Keep cull piles away from field operations. Do not spray, tie, harvest, or handle wet plants as that can spread the disease.

                    Tomato yellow leaf curl is a disease of tomato caused by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In March 2007, it was identified for the first time in California and currently has a limited distribution. An educational brochure was created at that time and is available to print.
                    Infected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants
                    infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. However, the most
                    diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves.
                    Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and
                    intervene and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened
                    and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which
                    is sometimes. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon
                    for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.
                    <br>Symptoms of TYLCV infection include severe stunting, reduction of leaf size, upward cupping/curling of leaves, chlorosis on leaves and flowers, and reduction of fruit production.
                    <br>Cultural Control
                    Growing tomato in open fields is much more constraining than growing under cover. In all regions
                    where TYLCV is endemic, seedlings need to be grown and kept in a glasshouse or a screen house in
                    order to prevent early infection by whitefly feeding. In Thailand, farmers grow tomato plants in
                    isolated paddy fields after rice harvesting. In Egypt the spread of TYLCV in open fields was
                    successfully controlled by rouging infected plants and removing all overwintered tomato crops before
                    the emergence of whitefly populations (Mazyad et al., 1986). Similar measures were undertaken in
                    Cyprus over 3 consecutive years resulting in a decrease in the incidence of the disease from 50 to
                    5% (Ioannou, 1987). In the Dominican Republic, a mandatory 3 months host-free growing period
                    which included bean, cucurbits, aborigine, melon, okra, pepper and tomato, significantly reduced
                    the inoculum and lowered to a minimum the incidence of TYLCV (Gilbertson et al., 2007). Early
                    planting when the incidence of B. tabaci is low, effectively reduced TYLCV infection in Egypt, Israel
                    and Cyprus. Interpolating with rows of TYLCV non-host trap plants such as squash and cucumber
                    have been used to divert whiteflies from tomato in the Jordan Valley, delaying TYLCV infection by 2
                    months (Al-Musa, 1982). Sticky yellow plastic polyethylene sheets have been used, with limited
                    success, to decrease the pressure of the whitefly population (Cohen et al., 1974). When
                    economically feasible, growing tomatoes in greenhouses covered with insect-proof 50-mesh screens
                    and double-doors constitutes the optimal solution for crop protection against the TYLCV whitefly
                    vector (Cohen and Berlinger, 1986; Ioannou, 1987). UV-absorbing plastic sheets or UV-absorbing
                    50-mesh screens, used as tunnels or as screen house covers, greatly reduced the infestation of
                    tomato plants by B. tabaci and the incidence of TYLCV (Antignus et al., 1998). Whitefly natural
                    enemies (Gerling, 1990) have not been used on a large scale in open fields.

            In Bangladesh, potato is primarily used as a vegetable, although in many countries of the world it constitutes the staple food and contributes more than 90% of the carbohydrate food source. Millions of tons of potatoes are processed annually in Europe into starch, alcohol, potato meal, flour, dextrose and other products. Some are processed into potato chips, dehydrated mashed potatoes, French fries and canned potatoes. Large quantities of potatoes in the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and other countries of Europe are grown specifically for manufacture of alcohol, starch, potato meal or flour, and for livestock feeding. Europeans consume much larger quantities of potato than the North Americans. Asian countries consume more rice than potato for carbohydrate foods.
            <br>In Bangladesh, although the principal use of potatoes is to make potato curry along with fish, meat, and eggs, there exists a great diversity in the consumption of potatoes. Notable among potato-based food items are the boiled potato, fried potato, mashed potato, baked potato, potato chop, potato vegetable mix, potato singara, potato chips, French fry etc. In recent years, bakeries and fast food shops have started preparing a wide variety of potato-based food delicacies.

                    Leaf infections are large brown blotches with a green gray edge. Leaves have large, dark brown blotches with a green gray edge; not confined by major leaf veins. Infections progress through leaflets and petioles, resulting in large sections of dry brown foliage. Stem infections are firm and dark brown with a rounded edge. Firm, dark brown, circular spots grow to cover large parts of fruits. Spots may become mushy as secondary bacteria invade. In high humidity, thin powdery white fungal growth appears on infected leaves, fruit and stems. Infected fruit have a dry brown rot.In high humidity, powdery white spores form on infected fruit, leaves and stems In cool, wet weather, entire fields turn brown and wilted as if hit by frost.
                    <br>The late blight pathogen is favored by free moisture and cool to moderate temperatures. Night temperatures of 50 to 60 F and day temperatures of 60 to 70 F are most favorable for disease development.

                    At the early stages of disease, the first visible symptoms of brown rot are usually on the foliage of
                    plants. These symptoms consist of wilting of the youngest leaves at the ends of the branches during
                    the hottest part of the day.<br>
                    At this stage, only one or half a leaflet may wilt, and plants may appear to recover at night, when the
                    Temperatures are cooler. As the disease develops under favorable conditions, all leaves in a hill may
                    wilt quickly and desiccate although dried leaves remain green, leading to general wilting and
                    yellowing of foliage and eventually plant death. Another common symptom that can be associated
                    with brown rot in the field is stunting of plants . These symptoms may appear at any stage of plant
                    growth.<br>
                    In young potato stems, infected vascular bundles may become visible as long, narrow, dark brown
                    streaks. In young, succulent plants of highly susceptible varieties, collapse of the stem may also be
                    observed. In well-established infections, cross-sections of stems and stolons may reveal brown
                    discoloration of infected tissues.
                    <br>In potato, it is tuber-borne. Spread from plant to plant results from bacteria moving from the roots of infected plants to neighboring plants. The bacteria can also be transported by irrigation water. Disease incidence is highest when soil moisture is high, such as during rainy periods.
                    <br>Rotate your crops regularly.
                    Install raised beds. Space plants out evenly to improve air circulation.
                    Test soil and amend to a pH of 6.2 to 6.5 for tomatoes and most garden vegetables.
                    Wash hands and gardening tools after handling infected plants.

                    Infected plants with only mild symptoms in the upper leaves may show typical symptoms in the older
                    leaves shaded by the top foliage. Such older leaves do not turn uniformly yellow but have a greenish
                    banding of veins on a yellow background . Blotchy type of mottling, waviness and undulating margins etc.,
                    in potato plants infected with PVX and PVA was noted by Pushkarnath in year 1964 . Under cool, cloudy
                    condition potato cultivars may develop as mottle, interveinal mosaic, mild mosaic and supermild mosaic .
                    Cariboo and York are two Canadian cultivars which exhibited a corky necrosis.
                    In many potato varieties PVX evokes an interveinal mosaic but in some plants rugosity of the leaves or
                    even crinkling has been reported by Brien and Rich . Sharma, et al.and Rich reported mild imperceptible
                    mottling of potato leaves (light green patches) which leads the chlorosis and stunning of the potato plants
                    infected with PVX. Potato virus X cause less perceptible mosaic which can be seen in shade or when a
                    white card is held behind the leaf . Mild mosaic and stunting PVX symptoms were observed by Jung, et
                    al.  in Koria. PVX (potex virus) usually causes faint mottle or inter-veinal mosaic in very young plants
                    depending upon the varieties. The symptoms are clearer at low temperature. PVX in combination with
                    PVY produces rugose mosaic while crinkle mosaic is the result of PVA combination. In some cultivars tuber necrosis is also reported Kumar, et al.,  Uniyal reported the mild mosaic symptom in potato crop by Potato virus X . The mild mosaic is the general symptom clearly visible on young plants at the beginning
                    of infection. As the season progresses due to increasing temperature, the mosaic symptom becomes less
                    apparent . Agrios reported the mosaic and stunting symptom of Potexvirus (PVX) in potato plant. Major
                    symptom of PVX are mosaic and dwarfing on potato plants but in potato cultivar Craigs Defiance to
                    necrosis was observed.
                    <br>In an infection of Potato virus A (mild mosaic), the plants have light crinkling, as well as mild yellow mottling. Leaf margins may be wavy and appear rough with sunken veins. Severity of symptoms depends on the strain, cultivar and weather conditions. Potato virus Y (Rugose mosaic) is the most severe of the viruses.
                    <br>Mosaic viruses are mostly spread by insects, especially aphids and leafhoppers. 
                    Control your seeds. 
                    To avoid seed-borne mosaic viruses, soak seeds of susceptible plants in a 10% bleach solution before planting.

                    Bacterial spot occurs on peppers and tomatoes. Many of the disease features are similar for both crops. The focus of the information presented here is on pepper. Worldwide, 16.5
                    million metric tons (36 million tons) of peppers are grown for fresh consumption and for use
                    in condiments. For many people in the U.S., the bell-shaped pepper fruit is the most familiar
                    however, non-bell-type peppers are more widely grown.
                    Bacteria attack the foliage, stems, and fruit of peppers and tomatoes. On peppers, lesions
                    may form on fruit, including the peduncle , but the major crop loss results from shedding of
                    Blossoms and young, developing fruit. Fruit that remain are usually non-marketable because of poor quality. They may have lesions and are often misshapen and damaged
                    from excessive exposure to the sun as a result of defoliation. This can result in sunscald on
                    the fruit. Diseased leaves drop prematurely resulting in extensive defoliation. As newly
                    emerging leaves become infected and defoliation of older, diseased leaves continues,
                    plants possess leaves mostly on their upper stems . Generally, defoliation is more common
                    for peppers than for tomatoes. Because the diseased foliage often remains on tomato
                    plants, affected plants may have a scorched appearance.
                    <br>The bacterium needs a temperature of 22 to 34oC with high humidity for maximum infection. Infection takes place at a wide range of temperatures from 15 to 35oC but the optimum is 24 to 30oC. Forty to fifty day old plants are most susceptible to this disease.
                    <br>Spraying of Agrimycin 100 alone or with 3gm/l copper oxychloride/ copper sulphate or 2gm/l mancozeb will control the bacterium. Disinfecting the seeds for 1 minute in 1.3 per cent sodium hypochlorite solution and drying in shade is the best way to reduce seed borne bacterium.

            Mango a FRUIT widely cultivated in the tropical and subtropical countries of the world. The origin of mango, Mangifera indica, of the family Anacardiaceae, is lost in antiquity. According to some authorities, horticultural forms are derived from the species M. indica, considered indigenous to the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh, Assam (India), and Myanmar.
            Mango trees grow widely throughout Bangladesh and are raised mostly as homestead plantations. Mangoes of this country belong mainly to two groups, such as, (i) superior or the elite varieties which are propagated through grafting and other vegetative means; and (ii) local varieties, raised by seedlings, popularly known as 'Deshhi' or 'Guti am'. The latter has no recognised varietal names, and the taste is not assured.
            Bangladesh produces a large number of superior varieties of mangos, mostly grown in Rajshahi, Nawabganj, and Dinajpur. These have wide demand in the market and are commercially important. Prominent among the elite varieties are Fazlee, Langda, Gopalbogh, Himsagar, Khirsapat, Ashhwina, Khisanbogh, Kuapahadi, Lata Bombai, Foria, Bombai, Kohitoor, Laksmanbhog, Mohanbhog, Misribhog etc.

It is possibly the world's oldest cultivated crop. It even spread into the Islands of the Pacific and to the West Coast of Africa as early as 200-300 BC. Banana (Musa paradisiaca, family Musaceae) is one of the tallest of the herbaceous plants with a pseudo-stem.
